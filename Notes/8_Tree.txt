Tree
	DOM is a tree structure
	computer chess game use tree
	abstract syntax tree
	Linked List is a single path tree

Binary Tree
	each node has 0/1/2 childs
	each node has only one parent
	
	perfect & full binary tree (127 3:21)
	perfect binary tree:
		No. level n Node = 2 * No. level (n - 1) Node
		No. level n Node = sum of all previous levels No. + 1
		No. Node = 2^h - 1;

	Binary Search Tree: (ordered , no-duplicate BT)
		Lookup O(log(N))
		Insert O(log(N))
		Delete O(log(N))

		Pros:
			Better than O(n)
			Ordered
			Flecible Size

		Cons:
			No O(1) Operations

		left child < parent < right child

		why is it prefered over hash table?
			Binary search tree preserve relationship

		unbalanced BST:
			operations become O(n) - it becomes a SLL in the worst case

			There're ways to balance a unbalanced tree (AVL & Red Black Tree)

	Binary Heap:
		Maximum heap - parent node > child nodes
		Minimum heap - parent node < child nodes
		left to right insertion
		commonly used in priority queue, data storage, sorting algorithms
		efficient at "getting K biggest elements" (=> O(K*log(N))

		Lookup O(N) - less ordered compared to BST
		Insert O(log(N))
		Delete O(log(N))

		pros:
			Priority

	Trie:
		specializedin searching
		find out if a word is in a text
		providing auto completion suggestion
		IP routing

		O(length of the word)
