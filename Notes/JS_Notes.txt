var, let and const
	https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/

	var 
		can be global & local, some confusion shoen on link 
		initialized as undefined

	let:
		limited to block (inside {})
		can be updated but not re-declared (in the same scope)
		not initialized

	const:
		limited to block (inside {})
		cannot be updated nor re-declared
		if const is pointing to an object:
			the object's state can be updated
			cannot reassign object to the const variable
