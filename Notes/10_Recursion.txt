Recursion:
	the most obvious problem:
		stack overflow - the call stack's memory is limited; sole - well-defined base case.

	Generally:
		1. Identify the base case
		2. Identify the recursivecase
		3. Get closer and closerto base case and return 
		(usually have 2 returns)

	trade-off Recursion VS Iterative:
		Anything recursive can be done iteratively

		Recursion:
			Pros: more readable, more DRY (do not repeat yourself)
			Cons: large Stack

			prefered for DS you don't know how deep they are

			Tail Call Optimization

	When to use recursion:
		traversing in trees and graphs, using a tree or converting sth into a tree
		Merge Sort, Quick Sort

		1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
		2. each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
		3. the solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand

		Divide and Conquew using recursion
