Hash Table:
	Java - Map; JS - Object; Python - dictionary

	Hash function:
		1. one-way
		2. constant output for same input 
		fast more important than complexity (secutiry)

	insert O(1)
	lookup O(1)
	delete O(1)
	search O(1)

	Hash Collision
		slows down reading and writing by O(n/k) -> O(n) (k is the size of hash table)
		deal with:
			1. linked list separate chaining
			other - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution

	Pros:
		Fast lookups
		Fast inserts
		Flexible Keys

	Cons:
		Unordered
		Slow key iteration

	JS specific:
		object:
			keys are only string

		new Map():
			key can be anything
			retains insertion order

		new Sets():
			only key, no value

		_method(): convention for private method
